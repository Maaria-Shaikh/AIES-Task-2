 Tic-Tac-Toe AI: Minimax vs Alpha-Beta Pruning

Developed by
Maaria Shaikh â€” CT-22019

Project Description
This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game where two AI strategies (Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning) play against each other.

Algorithms Used
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Explores all possible game states to make optimal moves.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimized version of Minimax that skips unnecessary branches to improve efficiency.

How to Run
```bash
python minimax_vs_alpha_beta.py# AIES-Task-2
Impementation of Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning
